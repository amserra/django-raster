Rasters for Django 4
====================

Django-raster provides raster data integration for Django projects
with a PostGIS database backend.

`See the docs for more information`__

__ http://django-raster.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

This repo is forked from https://github.com/geodesign/django-raster, which is a project that is no longer maintained.
It simply allows to use the package in Django 4. No features will be added in the future.

You can install it by doing:

`pip install git+https://github.com/amserra/django-raster4`
